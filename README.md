# VT-Script
The script scans IPs, domains, and hashes for malicious activity, reading targets from a user file. It uses VirusTotal API (with a stored key) to fetch info and generates a CSV with targets, types, and scores. The script includes progress tracking, error handling, and instructions, making it a user-friendly, customizable tool.
